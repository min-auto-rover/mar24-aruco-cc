Thank you for considering contributing to the MAR project. This project is
supervised by Dr Klaus-Peter Zauner. It is students like you that make this
project awesome.


SETUP
=====

Editor
------
You are strongly suggested to use Emacs or other text-based editors. This
project requires cross-compilation, thus an IDE is likely to provide wrong code
suggestions.

Environment
-----------
You should also follow the instructions in README to obtain and setup the SDK.
You should use a language server that saves your time. For example, if you are
using clangd, you may want to create a file called compile_flags.txt and include
the following lines as a minimum configuration:
> -Wall
> -I/path/to/sysroots/arm1176jzfshf-vfp-oe-linux-gnueabi/usr/include
>
which enables all warnings and tells the complier where to find the libraries.
Please note that during compilations, all warnings will be treated as errors and
will stop the compile process. You must ensure that there are zero warnings in
the code when you submit.

We assume that you know how to use GNU Autotools, the build system.

Code Style
----------

Inherits Linux
..............

The code style is almost the same as the linux style. The only difference is the
braces for functions. Instead of
> int
> main(int argc, char* argv[]) // newline here
> {
>         // foo
> }
we omit that line break and use the following:
> int
> main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
>         // foo
> }

Make use of M-x c-set-style <RET> linux <RET> if using Emacs.

Tab Width
.........

The tab width is 8 characters. A tab is never 4 characters wide, nor 2
characters wide. A tab is not 8 spaces. A tab is one '\t' character.

Line Width
..........

A line should never exceed 80 characters. Break the line using proper C/C++
syntax if the line exceeds 80 characters. A tab consumes 8 characters space.
Beware that the code is possible to be reviewed on the Linux system we built
over serial, and any lines exceeding 80 characters will cause trouble.

Make use of auto-fill-mode if using Emacs.
